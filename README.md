# HangMan

This is a simple version of the HangMan. I've created this funny game just to review the client server
comunication using socket.

The entire application is based on two classes

 - **EchoServer**: here you can find the logic of the game. It's a Thread that, once started, listens and responds to the information that client sends.
 - **EchoClient**: this is the part of the software that interacts with user. Basically asks to the player a letter and send this single character to the server.

It's all, download and play! :video_game:
